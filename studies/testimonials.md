### Academia and research

> "F#...levels the playing field between beginners and experienced programmers."

 - Prof Susan Eisenbach
 - Dean of Learning and Teaching Imperial College, United Kingdom 

Functional languages are ideal for teaching clear thinking, for solving problems 
amenable to code solu­tions and it levels the playing field between beginners and 
experienced programmers. The first programming language taught has a substantial 
influence on what language students use when they have a free choice. F#, once it 
is platform independent, has the potential to become the first programming language.

> "F#...made it trivial..." 

 - **Prof David Walker**
 - Princeton University, United States,

Our graduate course on Parallelism this Fall is full, even though it assumes no 
experience with functional programming or F#. The students are preparing the courseware 
themselves, and one of the topics we are studying is functional reactive programming (FRP) 
with continuous, time-varying behaviors. F#, with its rich graphics libraries, made it 
trivial to construct a super-fun assignment involving purely functional and interac­tive 
animation of a mock solar system.

> "When F# is combined with Visual Studio... productivity goes through the roof!"

 - **Professor Nigel Horspool**
 - University of Victoria, Canada

F# programs tend to be much shorter than their equivalents in other languages, and the 
fewer lines of code required, of course, the higher the productivity. When F# is combined 
with Visual Studio, which provides help with remembering the methods attached to different 
data types and how to use those methods, productivity goes through the roof!

> "Either it wont compile or its correct"

 - **Simon Cousins**
 - [In what areas might the use of F# be more appropriate than C#?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2785029/in-what-areas-might-the-use-of-f-be-more-appropriate-than-c)

I have written an application to balance the national power generation schedule for a portfolio 
of power stations to a trading position for an energy company. The client and server components 
were in C# but the calculation engine was written in F#. 

The use of F# to address the complexity at the heart of this application clearly demonstrates 
a sweet spot for the language within enterprise software, namely algorithmically complex 
analysis of large data sets. My experience has been a very positive one.
